# things I can do in my data

```{r}
# to see how many people are not in labor force (dichotomous variables)
#table(PRData$LABFORCE)
# to test if it's significant
#distribution=table(PRData$LABFORCE)
#chisq.test(distribution) # notice the the input is a table
# to clean the NA, and only keep people from 25-65
#symbolsForNA=c('â€ ') # you can put here the symbols you want to convert to NA
#schoolPub[-1]=lapply(schoolPub[-1],
                 #function(x) 
                   #replace(x,x%in%symbolsForNA, NA))
#table(schoolPub$Title.1.School.Wide.)
```

```{r}
# to see the age distribution (polytomous variables)
# central value
```

# To see the relationship between 2 variables: use bivariate case
## here i want to see the relationship between age and labforce, 
## which is categorical-numerical

# I want to see which variable affects the laborforce most, so I can use clustering/PCA tech.
# I can set levles on age (25-35,35-45,45-55,55-65)
# If i want to make a map, i need to merge extra data


```{r}
# get the data from github
dataURL <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TianXinyu/FinalProject/master/usa_00001.csv"
data <- read.csv(dataURL)
class(data)
```

```{r}
names(data)
# I dont need detailed race
data$RACED <- NULL
head(data)
```

```{r}
# delete the NAs, inthe data file, NA in labforce is coded as "0"
data$LABFORCE[data$LABFORCE==0] <- NA
table(data$LABFORCE)
str(data)
```
