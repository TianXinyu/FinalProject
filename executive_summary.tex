\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
In this report, I focused my research on the labor force market in Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland. From the data, I found that the labor force participation rate in Puerto Rico(0.58) is far lower than it in the U.S. mainland(0.75).

To find out the reason that caused such a huge difference, I took age and disability as two main variables and tried to explore the relationship between these variables and the labor force statue.

The data I am using in this research is ACS\footnote{American Community Surveys, from IPUMS USA(https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml).} 2016 1-year data.
